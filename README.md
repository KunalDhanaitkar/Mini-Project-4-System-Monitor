# System Monitor using Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is made to build web applications synchronously using HTTP and enables you to trigger realtime notifications from your synchronous Python Web stack since it comes with a HTTP Pusher service.
